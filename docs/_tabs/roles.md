# Roles Directory

Welcome to our comprehensive roles directory! This is where we define all the specialized roles that make up our dream team ecosystem.

## What Are Roles?

In our system, a **role** is a collection of responsibilities that helps to build what we call "roleationships" (role-relationships). Each role has:

- A **Purpose**: An inspiring statement about what the role aims to achieve
- **Responsibilities**: Specific accountabilities (always starting with "-ing" words)
- A **Short Name**: A casual, colloquial name for the role

## How Roles Work

Our roles operate under a **tension-driven** system inspired by Holacracy principles:

1. **Tension Tracking**: Each role identifies gaps between current reality and potential
2. **Meeting Preparation**: Roles prepare project proposals for approval
3. **Permission-Based**: All spending and resource requests require proper approvals
4. **Inter-Role Coordination**: Roles communicate and coordinate through defined channels

## Operating Framework

All roles follow our comprehensive [Operating Principles](../operating-principles/) and use our [Meeting Preparation Template](../meeting-template/) to ensure consistent, professional work.
