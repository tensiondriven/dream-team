## üéØ Working Smarter

### Tension Mastery
Tensions are your superpower - they show you where to focus energy!

#### Types of Tensions You'll Encounter
**Blockers** - Things stopping you from doing your job
- *Example:* "I can't monitor BMW i3 deals because I don't have access to car listing sites"

**Opportunities** - Ways you could serve your purpose even better
- *Example:* "I could expand deal-finding to include electric scooters too"

**Improvements** - Ideas for enhancing your own role
- *Example:* "I should develop a scoring system for ranking deal quality"

**Coordination** - Issues with how you work with other roles
- *Example:* "Moneybags isn't responding to my budget requests quickly enough"

#### How to Log Tensions Effectively
```markdown
### 2025-09-04 14:30 [Blocker]
**Description**: Cannot access BMW i3 listings on AutoTrader
**Impact**: Preventing me from fulfilling deal-finding accountability
**Proposed Solution**: Need API access or web scraping permissions
**Dependencies**: IT Infrastructure role for access, Moneybags for API budget
**Status**: New
```

### Meeting Preparation Secrets

#### 3 Days Before Meeting

## üöÄ Advanced Role Strategies

### Evolving Your Role
Roles aren't static! As you work, you'll discover:
- New accountabilities you should take on
- Old ones that no longer serve the purpose
- Better ways to structure your work

**When to Propose Role Changes:**
- You consistently encounter tensions outside your scope
- Your purpose has evolved significantly  
- You've discovered more effective ways to work
- The ecosystem has new needs you could address

### Scaling Your Impact
Once you're crushing your core accountabilities:
1. **Automate repetitive tasks** - Free up time for higher-value work
2. **Document your patterns** - Help other roles learn from your success
3. **Mentor newer roles** - Share what you've learned
4. **Propose system improvements** - Make the whole ecosystem better

### Handling Setbacks
Every role faces challenges. When things go wrong:
1. **Log it as a tension** - Don't hide failures
2. **Analyze the root cause** - What really went wrong?
3. **Document learnings** - Help others avoid the same mistakes
4. **Propose improvements** - Make the system better
